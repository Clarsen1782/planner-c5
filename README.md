## Installation

This site was created to help busy professionals keep track of their day-to-day tasks and meetings. The current hour will be shown in red so it can be easily seen. The past hours will turn grey so if something was missed it can be seen and taken care of. While the future hours show in green.
The tasks and meetings will be saved in the local storage and will continue to show even if the scheduler is closed and reopened.

## Usage 

This website is set up to be easy to use. Simply add in tasks as they come up and click the save button on each hour:
